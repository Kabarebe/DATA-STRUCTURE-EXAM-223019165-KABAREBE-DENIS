In hello world c++ program (#include<iostream>) is for including libraries for input and output(cin>> and cout<<)
(using namespace std;) is for using standard namespace and reduce duplication of std:: prefix 
(int) indicate that function will return integer value either 0 for successful execution or other number for error
(Main()) indicate start of execution
(cout<<"hello,world";) is for displaying hello,world
(Return 0;) indicate successful execution


in EXAMPLE 4.4 program (#include<iostream>) is for including libraries for input and output(cin>> and cout<<)
(using namespace std;) is for using standard namespace and reduce duplication of std:: prefix 
(int) indicate that function will return integer value either 0 for successful execution or other number for error
(Main()) indicate start of execution
(int age=20) is declaring integer variable called age with value of 20
(double price=19.99) is declaring double variable called price with value of 19.99
(char grade='a') is declaring character varibale called grade with value 'a'
(string name='alice') is declaring string variable called name with value 'alice'
(cout<<name;) is for displaying name we had declared
(cout<<age;) is for displaying age we had declared
(cout<<price;) is for displaying price we had declared
(cout<<grade;) is for displaying grade we had declared
(Return 0;) indicate successful execution


in EXAMPLE 5.1 c++ program (#include<iostream>) is for including libraries for input and output(cin>> and cout<<)
(using namespace std;) is for using standard namespace and reduce duplication of std:: prefix 
(int) indicate that function will return integer value either 0 for successful execution or other number for error
(Main()) indicate start of execution
(string name;)declares string variable called name with no value
(int age;)declares int variable called age with no value
(cout<<'enter name') for user to enter his/her name
(cin>> name;) inputting name entered by user
(cout<<'enter age') for user to enter his/her age
(cin>>age;) inputting age enterd by user
(cout<<'hello,'<<name<<'!'<<'you are'<<age<<'years old';)for final displaying age and name of user
(Return 0;) indicate successful execution


in EXAMPLE 6.1 c++ program (#include<iostream>) is for including libraries for input and output(cin>> and cout<<)
(using namespace std;) is for using standard namespace and reduce duplication of std:: prefix 
(int) indicate that function will return integer value either 0 for successful execution or other number for error
(Main()) indicate start of execution
(int a=10,b=3) declares two integer varibale a=10,b=3
(cout<<'sum'<<a+b<<;)calculation of sum and output it
(cout<<'differance'<<a-b<<;)calculation of substraction and output it
(cout<<'product'<<a*b<<;)calculation of product and output it
(cout<<'quotient'<<a/b<<;)calculation of division and output it
(cout<<'remeinder'<<a%b<<;)calculation of reminder and output it
(Return 0;) indicate successful execution
